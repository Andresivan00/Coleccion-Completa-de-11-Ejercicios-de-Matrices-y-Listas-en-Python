# Complete Collection of 11 Matrix and List Exercises in Python

**The ultimate repository** to learn how to work with **matrices (lists of lists)**, **interactive menus**, **classic algorithms**, and **clean code structure** in Python.

### What this program does

A **main menu** with **11 fully functional programming exercises**, all well-structured:

| #  | Exercise                      | Description                                                    |
| -- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | 3×3 Matrix with numbers 1–9   | Fills sequentially and displays neatly                         |
| 2  | 5×n Random Matrix             | Requests number of columns and generates numbers 0–10          |
| 3  | Sum of two n×n matrices       | Generates A and B → calculates C = A + B                       |
| 4  | Complete 4×4 Menu             | Fill, sum row/column/diagonals, average (with validations)     |
| 5  | 3×3 Matrix without duplicates | Uses `random.shuffle` for unique numbers 1–9                   |
| 6  | Random row or column sum      | Program randomly decides what to sum                           |
| 7  | Tic-Tac-Toe Game              | Two human players, detects winner/draw                         |
| 8  | Survey of 10 people           | Generates data and calculates percentages and average salaries |
| 9  | Advanced 5×5 Matrix           | Average, max, even numbers, diagonals, selection sort          |
| 10 | Read 5×4 Matrix from keyboard | Full input validation                                          |
| 11 | Irregular Matrix              | Each row has a different number of columns                     |

### Key Features

* Clean, commented, and modular code (reusable functions)
* Robust input validation (`request_integer`)
* Neatly aligned matrix printing
* Correct use of list comprehensions
* Educational algorithms: Selection Sort, Tic-Tac-Toe, irregular matrices
* All with **pure Python** – no external libraries (only `random`)

### Perfect for

* Students of beginner, intermediate, and advanced programming
* Teachers looking for real, well-solved exercises
* Exam, homework, or certification preparation
* Educational project portfolios
